The PuppetDB CLI project provide Puppet subcommands for querying PuppetDB data,
via `puppet query <query>`, and PuppetDB administrative tasks, `puppet db
<import|export|status>`. The `query` subcommand will allow you to query PuppetDB
using either the upcoming PQL syntax of the traditional PuppetDB query syntax
(also known as AST). The `db` subcommand is a replacement for the older
`puppetdb <export|import>` commands with faster startup times and much
friendlier error messages.

## Compatibility

This CLI is compatible with
[PuppetDB 4.0.0](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/4.0/release_notes.html#section)
and greater.

## Installation

Please see
[the PuppetDB documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/puppetdb/latest/pdb_client_tools.html)
for instructions on how to install the `puppet-client-tools` package.

## Installation from source

Using `rustc` and `cargo` (stable, beta, or nightly):

```bash

  $ export PATH=./target/debug:$PATH
  $ cargo build
  
```

When building on OSX or Windows you will also need to install openssl and use
that for building the PuppetDB CLI. For OSX users the simplest way to do this is
using Homebrew and running the following commands before the `cargo build`:

```bash

  $ export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=$(brew --prefix)/lib
  $ export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix)/include

```

## Usage

Example usage:

```bash

$ puppet-query 'nodes[certname]{}'
[
  {
    "certname" : "baz.example.com"
  },
  {
    "certname" : "bar.example.com"
  },
  {
    "certname" : "foo.example.com"
  }
]
$ puppet-db status
{
  "puppetdb-status": {
    "service_version": "4.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "service_status_version": 1,
    "detail_level": "info",
    "state": "running",
    "status": {
      "maintenance_mode?": false,
      "queue_depth": 0,
      "read_db_up?": true,
      "write_db_up?": true
    }
  },
  "status-service": {
    "service_version": "0.3.1",
    "service_status_version": 1,
    "detail_level": "info",
    "state": "running",
    "status": {}
  }
}

```

## Configuration

The Rust PuppetDB CLI accepts a `--config=<path_to_config>` flag which allows
you to configure your ssl credentials and the location of your PuppetDB.

By default the tool will use `$HOME/.puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf` as
it's configuration file if it exists. You can also configure a global
configuration (for all users) in `/etc/puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf`
(`C:\ProgramData\puppetlabs\client-tools\puppetdb.conf` on Windows) to fall back
to if the per-user configuration is not present.

The format of the config file can be deduced from the following example.

```json
  {
    "puppetdb" : {
      "server_urls" : [
        "https://<PUPPETDB_HOST>:8081",
        "https://<PUPPETDB_REPLICA_HOST>:8081"
      ],
      "cacert" : "/path/to/cacert",
      "cert" : "/path/to/cert",
      "key" : "/path/to/private_key",
      "token-file" : "/path/to/token (PE only)"
      },
    }
  }
```
